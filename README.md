# LeoVegasTV

This is a test to join as Engineer Javascript for LeoVegas.

### To run the project
Go into LeoVegasTV/app-front and:

- run: `npm i & npm start`
- for tests run `npm run test`

### Technologies:

- React - create-react-app
- Context-API
- Typescript
- Styled-Components
- Jest y RTL (Testing)
- Eslint (Linter) and Prettier (Code formatter)

I have use a 'Mobile first' approach, under a structural and creational design, trying to encapsulate the code with a defined purpose.

***services-resolver-handle-hook-component***


### How works:
The app has been structured by a **Nav** and a **Body**.

The nav has the LeoVegas Icon, clicking navigate to main view.

The main view displays a list of movies in cards, which shows us the cover, score average, and two buttons: A star for saved in the movie in a favorites list, and a clock to save in a watch later list. Both list are saved separately in the localstorage.

At the top there is a filter which allows us filter movies by title, includes pagination.
Just below we have a couple of buttons to navigate to the saved lists.
